But he had his reasons for not doing it, which he explained and I am not going to, you know, argue about those reasons.</p></blockquote><p>Further, Barr stated the Justice Department found “many of the instances” that the special counsel found “would not amount to obstruction” as a matter of law.</p><blockquote><p>“[W]e didn’t agree with... a lot of the legal analysis in the report.

He provided both sides of the issue, and his conclusion was he wasn’t exonerating the president, but he wasn’t finding a crime either.”</p></blockquote><p>Of course, this is not the first time Comey has harshly criticized Barr.

President Trump has long accused Comey and other top FBI officials of abuses of power during the bureau’s counter counterintelligence operation against his presidential campaign.</p><p>Addressing the media at a White House event, President Trump was asked which officials he views are guilty of treason and Comey was atop the list.</p><blockquote><p>“I think a number of people.
