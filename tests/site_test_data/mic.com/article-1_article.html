Chances are, your mind wanders to the people that shared the experience with you. Sights can be pretty and food can be mouthwatering, but if you’re in the company of folks who drag you down, well, you might have this lingering desire to book an earlier flight home. </p><p>According to Dr. <a class href="https://michaelbrein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Brein</a>, travel psychologist and author of <a class href="https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Tales-Women-Alone-MeToo/dp/1886590532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel Tales: Women Alone: The #MeToo of Travel</a>, everyone possesses certain “travel personalities,” which can be a combination of independent or dependent, extrovert or introvert and active or passive. If you and your travel partner— be it a significant other, sibling or friend — fall into two different categories, you’re not necessarily destined for a miserable trip, you might just need to work a little harder to have a great one.</p><p>Here’s how to position yourself as a great travel partner.</p><p><b>Stay organized</b></p><p>You don’t want your partner tapping their wrist and rolling their eyes as you search desperately under the hotel nightstand for your passport. When one of you goes down, so does the other. If you aren’t motivated enough to bring a travel folder storing all of your important documents in one place for your own sake — like insurance information, medical and emergency contacts and flight information — do it for your travel partner. </p><p><b>Keep your head up</b></p><p>Traveling won’t always look like a giant Instagram photo. In fact, you spend more of the travel process planning for it than actually experiencing it. Comparing flights, reading hotel reviews and packing aren’t exactly glamorous, but you should use this opportunity to bond with your travel partner over your soon-to-be-shared adventures. A positive attitude from the get-go will set the framework for a more enjoyable trip. It’ll be easier to maintain a positive attitude throughout the entire trip if you go into it with one. For instance, while misery loves company during a flight delay or weather hiccup, someone has to eventually bite the bullet and say “Hey, it’s no big deal. These things happen.” And that person might have to be you.</p><p>“Travel hassles are a rite of passage,” said Dr. Brein. “Treat them as part of the whole adventure. Overcoming some sort of destabilizing or unpleasant task or event related to the destination makes you value and cherish your arrival. In an ironic way, it also makes it more memorable.”</p><p> </p><figure class="go"><div class="gp" style="padding-top: 66.7%;"><div class="hl"><noscript><img src="https://imgix.mic.com/mic/2tfynyajlgehhuhc5wzgjzqjx8qoifo9dcxpdl4iiqlievun4zpxyqvnvsjeoda4.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70" srcSet="https://imgix.mic.com/mic/2tfynyajlgehhuhc5wzgjzqjx8qoifo9dcxpdl4iiqlievun4zpxyqvnvsjeoda4.jpg?w=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 349w, https://imgix.mic.com/mic/2tfynyajlgehhuhc5wzgjzqjx8qoifo9dcxpdl4iiqlievun4zpxyqvnvsjeoda4.jpg?w=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.mic.com/mic/2tfynyajlgehhuhc5wzgjzqjx8qoifo9dcxpdl4iiqlievun4zpxyqvnvsjeoda4.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 646w, https://imgix.mic.com/mic/2tfynyajlgehhuhc5wzgjzqjx8qoifo9dcxpdl4iiqlievun4zpxyqvnvsjeoda4.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 1292w" sizes="(min-width:768px) 646px, 349px" alt class="hm" /></noscript></div></div><figcaption>Source: Cookie Studio/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p><b>Don’t be too rigid</b></p><p>We all have our “schtick.” For some of us, that means lights out shortly after sundown, or eating at restaurants that only serve burgers and fries.
