    "plain_content": "<div><div><p>Trump isn’t doing as well in the polls as any politician would like and the mainstream media is only too happy to report it. Every morning, clicking on sites like The Hill will give you headlines that tell you how horrible Trump is doing with voters.</p><p>“GOP frets about poll numbers” trumpeted The Hill on Wednesday, which then went into talking about how anonymous Republican pollsters found Trump’s approval ratings “problematic.”</p><p>On Tuesday of last week, The Hill also ran a headline titled “Biden leads Trump by ‘landslide proportions’ in new national poll,” which, as the title implies, discusses Joe Biden’s 13 point lead over Trump in a Quinnipiac University survey.</p><p>Other outlets such as CBS News, have released articles touting the fact that Biden is ahead in key battleground states.</p><p>From the media’s telling, you’d think that Trump’s days as President are numbered.</p><p>However, the rallies tell a different story.</p><p>If a photo can paint 1,000 words then all of those words say Trump is going to trounce Biden in 2020. The size differences between the two rallies is stark.</p><blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Interesting comparisons of rallies. Biden's on the left, Trump's on the right. Trump's is clearly larger, and according to Heavy, the turnout for Trump's rally is bigger than the population of Montoursville, the town it was held in. pic.twitter.com/FLT7A1Lzsn</p><p>— Brandon Morse (@TheBrandonMorse) June 19, 2019</p></blockquote><p>The photo above of Biden’s rally was taken at his initial campaign launch. It’s a decent size to be sure, but interestingly, the reported size of the rally is muddled by various accounts. According to Heavy, one reporter estimated the crowd size at 2,000 while another estimated it at 6,000.</p><p>One can assume from the range of numbers that one person is trying to fudge the crowd size. Regardless, Trump’s is clearly larger with an estimated crowd size approaching 5,000. That was back in June.</p><p>Fast forward to Tuesday and you have Trump filling out the stadium in Orlando with some 20,000 attendees.</p><blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Amway Center nearly full for Trump rally tonight in Orlando. Normal capacity for a basketball game here = 18,500 and for a concert = 22,000, per venue staff. Campaign estimates final crowd size will be somewhere in between. pic.twitter.com/gMdYZSRa3y</p><p>— Monica Alba (@albamonica) June 18, 2019</p></blockquote><p>Even back in April, the rally comparisons were pretty different, with Trump packing stadiums and Biden gathering people into a room.</p><blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">And this was Biden's rally in April pic.twitter.com/XafKIaP4zX</p><p>— Brandon Morse (@TheBrandonMorse) June 19, 2019</p></blockquote><p>Unless Trump does something that severely upsets the populace — and I’m not exactly sure what that would have to be at this point — I imagine this packed rally trend will continue.</p><p>I only bring this up because I’m getting some serious 2016 vibes.</p><p>During the last presidential election, I watched as poll after poll told me that Clinton was a shoo-in for President. Yet Clinton could hardly pack a room full of people. In one very telling story, Clinton’s staff had made room for an entire warehouse to be filled for a speech. The problem was that so few people turned out that they had to literally place walls near the back of the crowd and shut off the lights to the rest of the building to make it look as if Clinton’s meager crowd was larger than it actually was.</p><p>While there have been no stories about Biden having to play with optics to that degree yet, I wouldn’t be surprised to see and hear similar stories come out as the campaign kicks into high gear. All Trump has to do is announce he’s showing up somewhere and thousands will show up there too. It becomes a major event.</p><p>I’m not getting that same vibe from Biden rallies.</p><p>Just like 2016, I’m seeing polls that favor Democrats but seeing crowds that favor Trump. I can only confirm with my own eyes and ears that at least one of them is more truthful and telling.</p></div></div>",

      {"text": "Almost a week ago, I wrote about how the Democrats were tripping over themselves in an effort to defend the free-market-busting bridge to a single-payer, government-run health care system passed into law under the Orwellian-sounding title of the Affordable Care Act. Of course, we know this better as Obamacare."},
      {"text": "In that piece, we learned that Obamacare was working exactly as designed, which is to say, that it is succeeding with the primary goal of its architect, Jonathan Gruber, in destroying private healthcare in order to make a way for a government owned-and-operated system."},
      {"text": "During this transitional phase, as premiums continue to skyrocket and insurance companies drop like flies out of the unprofitable insurance exchanges, Gruber appeared on CNN in order to whitewash the truth about Obamacare’s premium hikes. In the interview he stated that 85% of Americans obtaining their insurance through the government-run exchanges receive government subsidies in order to offset premium increases, so they are unaffected. Besides the fact that 73.6% of all statistics are made up, Gruber’s numbers leave out vitally important information, and they don’t add up."},
      {"text": "There are millions of Americans who don’t get their insurance through the exchanges, which means they are ineligible for subsidies, and therefore, are paying the full cost of these ever-increasing premiums. Of course, this is also part of the plan by making insurance outside of the Obamacare exchanges too expensive to purchase. This results in Americans being forced into the government-run exchanges."},
      {"text": "But even if everyone currently purchasing their insurance outside of the exchanges began buying it within the exchanges, millions would still be ineligible for subsidies because they make too much money."},
      {"text": "Even if you accept the lie that Obamacare is working, literally Millions of Americans are being left out with no solution to these skyrocketing healthcare premiums. Either they cut expenses where they can—phone, cable, FOOD—or they go without insurance and simply pay the tax fine. And even if they opt not to buy insurance, they lose because Gruber wants the penalty tax to go up as well."},
      {"text": "Mark Twain once said, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.” If Mr. Twain were alive today, he could have been talking about Obamacare."}
