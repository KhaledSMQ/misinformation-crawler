John Kennedy (R-La.) on whether the White House had laid out a clear path forward. “Both bright guys, but they don’t have decision-making authority. What I’m hoping we can do is when the president gets back from the U.K. we can all sit down and try to figure out how to move forward together.”</p><p>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) also underscored the need to talk directly with Trump.</p><p>“The problem is we didn’t have the decision makers there.

Time’s wasting,” Cornyn said. “What we need to do is get in front of the president and have that conversation.”</p><p>Kennedy is one of a handful of Republicans who have spoken to Trump directly about the tariffs, along with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). Both said Trump seems unmoved.</p><p>In comments to reporters in London, Trump said the tariffs are “likely” to go in place next Monday and said his party would be unwise to defy him, citing “tremendous Republican support.”</p><p>“I don't think they will do that,” Trump said. “If they do, it's foolish.</p><p>A veto override may be difficult to achieve.</p><p>There may not be 20 Republicans in the Senate who are willing to defy Trump, particularly as the GOP seeks to defend its majority and avoid primary challengers from the right. And getting more than 50 House Republicans to join them could prove even harder given the stronger support Trump’s hardball tactics have among the House minority.</p><p>The topic wasn’t even debated during a closed-door House GOP Conference meeting on Tuesday morning. While there have been a dozen or so moderate Republicans willing to buck the president on issues like the emergency declaration on the wall, even lawmakers who vehemently oppose Trump’s tariffs believe there is little to no chance that enough GOP lawmakers would vote to override a presidential veto.</p><p>But in the immediate term, Republicans want to avoid all that.
