The state is America’s top corn and ethanol producer, with 44 biofuel plants that help support more than 40,000 jobs. It holds the first presidential nominating contest in 2020, and any Democratic candidate who wants to win that vote and peel off some of Republican President Donald Trump’s Iowa support in the general election will likely have trouble if lukewarm on biofuels.</p><p>“I really hope we can finally get some answers to what happened,” said Dave Walton, a farmer who grows corn, soybeans and livestock. “Right now, I am suspicious of anything Biden will say about his commitment to ethanol, but we do need to hear from him.”</p><p>Iowa farmers and ethanol producers sent a letter, seen by Reuters, to Biden in 2014 asking him to explain his actions.

The campaign said the country’s energy revolution must be “fought for and with our farmers.”</p><p>“By doubling down on our national renewable fuel standard obligations and implementing stronger, bolder commitments that invest in ethanol and biofuels, we can loosen big oil’s grip on our nation while spurring economic growth in areas hard-hit by Trump’s trade war,” said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates.</p><h3>BACKING BIOFUELS</h3><p>In Iowa, ethanol is not as much a threshold Democratic Party issue as abortion rights or gun control.</p><p>Ethanol is opposed by many Democrats, who see it as maintaining the reliance on fossil fuels and combustible engine vehicles.
