With the exception of tax hikes, which in my</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">opinion will destroy American jobs, everything is on the table.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: House Speaker John Boehner throwing down the gauntlet in</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">negotiations over raising the federal debt ceiling. Here's that debt</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">clock again. We have got a live picture there in New York and it waits</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">for no one. Soon, the numbers will crash through the debt ceiling,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">exceeding the amount the U.S. is legally allowed to borrow. The stakes</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">couldn't be higher, so what is the solution?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Joining me now, Doug Holtz-Eakin, who ran the Congressional Budget</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Office and served as John McCain's chief economic adviser in 2008.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Nobel prize winning economist Paul Krugman of the New York Times.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Sheila Bair, who is wrapping up her term as chairman of the Federal</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Deposit Insurance Corporation. And Roger Altman, a former deputy</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. Thank you all for</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">being here.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">This seems to be a never-ending conversation, but the limit we're</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">now hitting up against. How is President Obama to respond to the call</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">for trillions, not billions of dollars in cuts?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: I think he cannot -- if he gives in on this, he's setting</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">himself up for repeated blackmail. He's basically saying that I care</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">about the economy more than the Republicans do, and therefore, every</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">time they threaten to blow it up -- even though it will hurt all of us</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">-- I am going to give in.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">So I think Obama has got very, very little wiggle room, even though</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">it's a terrible thing.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: Lots of economists are saying the Republicans are playing</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">with fire, that hitting the debt limit, exceeding it is not like</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">shutting down the government. It could cause a real cascading economic</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">crisis.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">HOLTZ-EAKIN: I don't think there is any great desire to hit the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">debt limit. The key is to recognize the limit is a symptom and that the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">fundamental problem is the underlying condition of the U.S. budget.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">What you're seeing now are calls for, both from Speaker Boehner and from</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, for real solutions to the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">real problems. It's not about the debt limit. It's making sure that in</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the short term you get cuts, in medium term you have an enforceable</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">path, and that you take care of something in the long term. The</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">entitlements have to be on the table.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: So, we do keep hearing this now. There obviously seems</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">to be the momentum for dealing with entitlements. But how? How does</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">one deal with Medicare, Medicaid? We already saw Paul Ryan and his plan</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">for Medicare. They seem to be running away from it now. So how does</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">one deal with this in a way that's real, rather than just ideological,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">if that's possible?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">BAIR: Right. Well, I'm a bank regulator, I'm not a budget expert,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">as some of these other gentlemen are, but we have been following this</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">very closely because we are very concerned about the outcome and how it</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">could impact the financial sector. But I've also worked in Washington a</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">long time, and it seems to me that if the pain is evenly distributed and</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the general population feels that there's fairness in whatever ultimate</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">outcome is agreed to, I hope, by the administration and the Congress,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">then I think it can politically, it can sell.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">I do think that both sides have a point. Last November, I published</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">an op-ed in the Washington Post, where I said if we didn't get these</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">deficits under control, I thought it would precipitate the next</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">financial crisis. I also agree with the administration, though, that</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">it's irresponsible even to entertain the idea of even a so-called</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">technical default on the public debt.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">So I think both sides have a point, and I hope they come together.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">And gentlemen, if you excuse me, I think maybe there's a little too much</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">testosterone in this debate. It's too much about winning and losing and</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">not enough of both sides are right, let's come together and have a</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">solution.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: What would a default mean? What impact would it have?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">ALTMAN: When I hear all this discussion about not voting to raise</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the debt limit, absolutely not and so forth, as we just heard earlier on</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the show, I have to roll my eyes a bit. Because, as Doug said, the debt</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">is a product of past budget decisions. And we have no alternative,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">therefore, but to raise the debt limit. For example, we're running a</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">deficit this year between 1.4 and 1.5 trillion. Those amounts have to</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">be borrowed, just like a household which is spending more than it takes</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">in. It has to raise cash. So there is no alternative but to allow the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">United States to continue to borrow. Therefore the debt limit has to be</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">raised. And should we somehow fail to do that and there be a default, I</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">agree with what the Fed chairman, Chairman Bernanke, said this past</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">this, which is that it would have severely destabilizing impacts.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">In fact, he said it would probably bring back the severe chaos we</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">saw in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">fall of '08.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: If I can just weight in, that this is -- U.S. debt -- it's</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">not just that our credibility is on the line, that people could get</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">spooked by the fact that we start to look like a Banana Republic.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">But it's also that U.S. debt plays a very special role in the world</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">system, right?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">A U.S. treasury bill is the gold standard of value, so much so that,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">during the height of the financial crisis, there were intervals where</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">U.S. Treasury bills had negative interest rates, because that's what</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">people had to hold.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">And if you're going to suddenly say, oh, that's not safe because the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">U.S. government is -- is a bunch of squabbling children, that is a real</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">possible catastrophe.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: And even the -- the Chamber of Commerce leader is saying</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">that it's time to make this deal, raise the debt, and not even talk</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">about cuts right now.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: That's right, because the cuts issue -- I'm sorry -- but</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">it's a huge thing, not to be settled in a few weeks of frantic yelling.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">HOLTZ-EAKIN: So the U.S. is very unique in that it has a debt</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">limit. So imagine we didn't have one. We'd have an enormous problem.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">We're on track to literally create a new financial crisis, given the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">trajectory.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">So dealing with the problem has to be the top priority. The</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">prospect of that financial crisis is anti-growth. It hurts the most</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">important job, which is jobs. And so I think the important thing is for</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the Democrats who ultimately control this town and need to provide the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">leadership on this to recognize that dealing with the problem, not the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">debt limit symptom, is the key. And that's the route to real success.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">ALTMAN: But you just made an important point, which is that the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">business community and the financial community, which are largely</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Republican, are entirely united in urging all of Washington, but</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">especially the Republican side, to pass the debt limit, don't trifle</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">with it and certainly don't trifle with default. And I think that's</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">significant</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">HOLTZ-EAKIN: And the last thing I'd say -- and this is important to</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">recognize -- that nine out of 10 Americans oppose just a pure increase</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">in the debt limit.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">So let's face it. This is a political exercise. They can't just</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">raise the debt limit. That's politically absolutely unacceptable. They</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">need to both raise it and fix the problem.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: And you also heard Speaker Boehner saying that everything</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">is on the table except -- except taxes.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Has that battle basically, Sheila, been completely won now or</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">settled; it's just not going to happen?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">BAIR: Well, I think that's a good question. I think probably</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">everything should be on the table.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">I think there's a difference between tax -- raising tax rates and</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">tackling tax expenditures, and I think there is the potential for a very</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">broad bipartisan consensus on tackling, getting rid of most of these tax</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">expenditures which are very destroying for the economy and were -- some</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">of them were a driver of the crisis.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">For instance, the mortgage interest deduction heavily subsidized</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">leverage, a lot of leverage with home borrowers. He favorable treatment</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">we give debt over equity financing also encouraged leverage with</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">financial institutions.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">There's a tremendous amount of potential revenue that could be</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">raised through tackling tax expenditures and it seems to me where the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">most likely place for a bipartisan consensus is. But tax revenues do</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">need to go up. I think that needs to be part of the solution.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: And this week, President Obama said to the Democrats,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">don't draw any lines in the sand; be flexible on this.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: Well...</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: On not particularly this issue, but in general.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: Yeah, and there's a problem because, if you're playing the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">responsible adult in the room and the other guy is willing to blow up</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the room if he doesn't get exactly what he wants, that puts you in a bad</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">negotiating position.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">I think there has to be some lines in the sand. There have to be --</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">you know, we're not going to dismantle the New Deal and the Great</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Society in a couple of weeks because the Republicans refuse to raise the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">debt limit.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: What would each one -- I want to go around the table and</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">ask you, what would each of you want to see coming out of these debt</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">ceiling talks that are going on right now?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">What is the best-case scenario?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">ALTMAN: Well, I think it will have to be, as Doug said, a serious</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">agreement to cut the deficit, or a downpayment, as the administration is</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">talking about, negotiated beforehand, and then pass the debt limit</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">increase in effect in exchange for that.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">So there will have to be a serious budget agreement. It will just</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">be a downpayment. It won't solve the entire $4 trillion 10-year</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">problem. But if it's not serious and pretty large, then I don't think</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">it will get the votes to pass the debt limit.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">BAIR: I guess I would like to see even more than that and have a</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">long-term plan. Four trillion over 10 years, I think, was a good</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">number. I think the Bowles-Simpson plan wasn't perfect, but it was a</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">good -- a good framework, a good example of how the pain could be evenly</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">distributed.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">But I agree, some short-term downpayment and some meaningful time</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">sequencing to get this done, I think, is necessary for credibility.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: I actually -- I think it may be necessary to take this up</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">to the limit. Because the fact of the matter, we do not...</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: And default?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: Possibly, if -- if we have complete -- if we have demands</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">for a large change in policy under threats of debt limit. This has to</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">be the point where you say, no, we don't believe in letting hostages be</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">taken.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: Do you -- I mean, do you agree with that?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">ALTMAN: No, I don't. I respect Paul, but I don't. I think default</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">would be a profound and hugely negative step. I think it would be</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">terribly destabilizing. I think it would reduce the amount of</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">institutions around the world that would, in the future, buy Treasury</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">debt and be...</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: But let me make my case here. We...</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">(LAUGHTER)</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">OK, but let me just say, we have an enormous budget dispute. We</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">have vastly opposed poles of policy. That's not something we should</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">resolve with a, you know, with a bomb hanging over our head. It's not</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">something we should try and change. And so Democrats have to make clear</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">that they're not going to let themselves be blackmailed in that way.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">HOLTZ-EAKIN: The first choice is real solutions, so real cuts in</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the near term, real targets over the medium term and real changes in the</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">entitlement proms.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">It has to be -- the most convincing thing for markets is the actual</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">changes in the policy. It's what Americans know has to be done and it's</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">what would be best for the country. The backup is just a framework; we</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">promise to hit this target or that target with enforcement -- that's</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">less compelling. It might be easier to say, but less compelling.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: An article -- a story that's in The Washington Post</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">today, talking about the negotiations between Vice President Biden and</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">congressional leaders, talking about federal pensions and what would</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">amount to about a 5 percent cut in salary. Does that -- is that a goer?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">HOLTZ-EAKIN: I believe, as a matter of politics, the federal</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">government employees can't be exempt from whatever the deal is. The</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">perception that somehow everything has to change for Americans, but that</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">the sheltered few in D.C. are exempt -- nah, it's not going to fly.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">BAIR: Can I just say I really -- I'm sorry, but I'm truly</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">frightened by even suggestions that we could default on Treasury debt.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">I think the knock on impact on that would be tremendous. We would lose,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">I assume, our AAA credit rating. A lot of institutions who currently</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">hold Treasuries would no longer be able to hold them. They would have</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">to liquidate them. That would create tremendous down-pressure on bond</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">prices.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">The fact that interest rates would spike in terms of what Treasury</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">has to pay -- those yields all consumer and business credit price off of</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Treasury yields, so borrowing costs for the real economy would go up.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Both consumers and businesses now are very hesitant and uncertain,</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">so they're not committing capital. If their borrowing costs go up, it</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">will -- it will be very detrimental to the economic recovery.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">So I'm sorry, but I think -- it truly frightens me.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: No, I'm terrified...</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">BAIR: I don't think we should be talking about it.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">(LAUGHTER)</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">KRUGMAN: But I'm also terrified by a blackmail political system.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">BAIR: Yeah.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">AMANPOUR: On that note -- on that terrifying note...</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">(LAUGHTER)</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">... we're going to have to pick this up another time.</p></div>",
