Now we raise our fists. Be men, join us. I as a woman will stand in front and protect you. Come represent your country.”</p><p>Strangely but consistently, American women, who have never really understood what it is to be denied their rights by a misogynist system of governance (sharia), have all but abandoned these women yearning to be free. But it’s worse than that. The leader of the women’s movement, chosen by the leftist elites, is a notorious pro-sharia, pro-terror anti-Semite, Linda Sarsour, who rather neatly plays a bait-and-switch game with Iran’s lack of freedom for women and their fight against death and oppression. Sarsour is trying to change the subject away from the Iran freedom movement to the supposed persecution of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, an utterly false and Islamic imperialist narrative.</p><p>Sarsour attacks those of us who stand in support of this growing movement in Iran. At the same time, fittingly enough, she is facing charges of aiding and abetting sexual harassment and abuse while she was director of the Arab American Association in New York City.</p><p>Meanwhile, regarding Iran, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, leading hard-left feminist women’s rights advocates – have said nothing. Nada. Not a statement of support, not a tweet, not a word.</p><p>While women in Iran are ripping off their hijabs, the left elites in America are working furiously to impose this garment of oppression on women as if it were some symbol of empowerment. We have seen Hijab Days in public schools all over the country. Then there was the One Million Hijabs For Shaima Alawadi movement supposedly in defense of Muslim women after Alawadi, a hijab-wearing Muslima, was supposedly murdered by an “Islamophobe.” That movement utterly collapsed when Shaima’s murderer was discovered to be not a hijab-hating Islamophobe, but her devout Muslim husband, who murdered his wife because she was working towards living a freer life. One Million Hijabs For Shaima — a cruel joke, at the expense of women living under the boot of Islamic law.</p><p>Women in Iran are marching and dying for a chance to live a free life. American women should be marching in solidarity, with their vagina hats at full attention. Instead, these savage hypocrites are attacking those of us who actually stand for women’s rights and human rights, even daring to challenge the sharia oppression that they constantly ignore, excuse, minimize, or deflect attention away from.</p><p>Exalting the idea of wrapping women in a cloth coffin under the guise of freedom best illustrates how subjugated and morally bankrupt, as well as timid, the left has become.</p><p>The prospect of feminists fighting for the hijab also unmasks this entire fraudulent movement for what it really is. It is ridiculous on its face that feminists laughably claim to be pursuing justice and equality for women, while in fact, their true goal is the obliteration of justice. I am profoundly anti-feminist because it is a phony movement. It is rooted in Marxism-Leninism, and does not genuinely represent women.</p><p>The feminist abandonment of women in Islam — Iran, the honor killing victims, the subjugation and oppression of women, forced marriage, child marriage, clitoridectomies, the misogyny of sharia law — should be absolute cause for all women to reject and repudiate the long dead and destructive feminist movement.</p><p>The women in Iran may not just bring down the mullahcracy in Iran; they may also blow it up here in America as well.</p><p>Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of The Geller Report and author of the bestselling book, FATWA: Hunted in America, as well as The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.
