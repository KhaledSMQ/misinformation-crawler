In normal heterosexual behavior, men must take the initiative. Many women want men to be persistent. All men are not going to be suave and welcome like James Bond.

How about telling an old creep where to get off - boss or no boss? How about embarrassing him publicly so he gets the idea he's off base? Some guys are pretty thick when it comes to women and you have to be really clear with them. The problem is that we have all (men and women) been brainwashed into believing we must never, ever hurt anyone's feelings - unless of course, they are not human ie conservative. So we have very little civility but a lot of useless and phony \"nice\". Women have sold their feminine souls and no longer have their natural instincts nor the natural responses to these very basic situations.</div><div>Of course, men have also sold their masculine souls. No self-respecting man would ever consider uttering Graydon's crass, pathetic jokes. However being an idiot should not be a hanging offense or we'd all be on the end of a rope one way or another. Clearly, your conclusions are correct - The destruction of God's plan for man is rolling along. But fear not, He will have the last laugh!</div></div></div></div><div><div></div><h3>Comments for \" Close to Home, Heterophobia Claims A Legislator\"</h3><div><p>Al Thompson said (October 18, 2018):</p><p>I think I have to agree with Marcos on this one. The man is immature for 69 years old and needs adult supervision. That's the kind of nonsense we might see in high school. But given the fact that he's a govtard his immaturity reflects the politics of the day. --</p><p>Thanks Al</p><p>But this was a social misstep, not rape, theft or murder.</p><p>henry</p></div><div><p>Alex C said (October 18, 2018):</p><p>If his approaches to women are coarse then it's likely his overall thinking is coarse so an easy target for them surely is he. Though I imagine his relationship to himself and to \"God\" cost him his job, the lead into these weird incidents. He couldn't substantiate his acts in his own workplace!! I bet he eats a lot of cow. 100 quid.</p><p>When they control a large portion of the masses it looks like they can decide for the constituents how these matters will play out. Perhaps he is a victim but I'm not worried an essential man has fallen, more than his rights were trampled on by the corporate judicial system like everyone else's. That is a/the lynchpin that holds everyone in a religious fear of God and government: a rogue corporate judiciary that puts citizens as a lower class and uses this status against them ad nauseum until they either Love to Hate or Hate to Love. Pick a side or one will be chosen for you at birth. Ye shall not know thyself.</p><p>Yet for people of magnificent conscience, it's all about balance. Stern logic can be a guide to many wonders of self. I wish the man was able to keep his job but he didn't even have the willpower to keep it, so... Meh</p><p>I get it though Dr. Henry. I'm glad you are keeping an eye on all this and I'm really using your information wisely I believe. :)</p></div><div><p>Robert K said (October 18, 2018):</p><p>These women were staff, and therefore this behavior was certainly egregious and completely unacceptable. As long as, in the face of patent material abundance, financial independence is artificially withheld from women (and men) by our legislatures, this kind of impropriety protected by the subordination inherent in the employer-employee relationship is utterly repugnant.</p></div><div><p>David S said (October 18, 2018):</p><p>t is only a matter of time before a heterosexual man who asks a female co-worker \"while smiling\" at her to go on</p><p>a date with him will be subject to dismissal from his job, especially if she doesn't think he is \"marriage material\".</p><p>In the short term, women will definitely gain the upper hand with office jobs because it will be safer for men to not work in an office but in the long term the typical male business owner is going to have an all-male office staff and those foolish women will be forced to work in more dangerous labour jobs or collect welfare.</p></div><div><p>Henry Makow received his Ph.D. in English Literature from the University of Toronto in 1982.
