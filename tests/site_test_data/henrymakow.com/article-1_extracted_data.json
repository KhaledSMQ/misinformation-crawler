He's an old pervert.</div><div>Here is a real appeal to heterosexuality - place this guy in a ring with the husband or father of each woman.</div><div>If he loses his job, good riddance, why should Canadians have people of low moral character in the legislature? Just because he stoked the fires and said something politically incorrect doesn't make him some sort of persecuted hero.

In normal heterosexual behavior, men must take the initiative. Many women want men to be persistent. All men are not going to be suave and welcome like James Bond. Some, like Graydon, are going to be coarse. His remarks were tasteless but he was just kidding. It should have been handled privately. It wasn't because it feeds into the #MeToo hysteria and puts a chill on male-female relations.</div></div><div>-----------------------</div><div>Diane writes- \"Being an idiot should not be a hanging offense\"</div><div><div>Here's a thought: how about women stop trading their self-respect for being liked? How about telling an old creep where to get off - boss or no boss? How about embarrassing him publicly so he gets the idea he's off base? Some guys are pretty thick when it comes to women and you have to be really clear with them. The problem is that we have all (men and women) been brainwashed into believing we must never, ever hurt anyone's feelings - unless of course, they are not human ie conservative. So we have very little civility but a lot of useless and phony \"nice\". Women have sold their feminine souls and no longer have their natural instincts nor the natural responses to these very basic situations.</div><div>Of course, men have also sold their masculine souls. No self-respecting man would ever consider uttering Graydon's crass, pathetic jokes. However being an idiot should not be a hanging offense or we'd all be on the end of a rope one way or another. Clearly, your conclusions are correct - The destruction of God's plan for man is rolling along. But fear not, He will have the last laugh!</div></div></div>",
