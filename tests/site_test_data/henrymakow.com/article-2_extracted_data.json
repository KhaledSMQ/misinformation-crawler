  "plain_content": "<div><div>In this 9-min video, a young Ukrainian woman outlines why she thinks that MGTOWs (men who go their own way) are justified. She outlines many reasons why young women have become toxic and marriage is a trap. The comments</div><div>below suggest that a growing number of men have rejected the company of women altogether. i.e. \"After a man marries a woman she quickly loses that 'new car smell', but the car payments go on and on.\"</div><div>Giving up on women is not the solution.</div><div>1/ MGTOW is the counterpart of feminism. The Communist elite wants to destroy heterosexual marriage and family. Don't succumb!</div><div>2/ The solution is to find a woman who will follow your lead. I tell my wife she can have power or love. She cannot have both. She chooses love . Women want power, in the form of male love. Heterosexual union is the exchange of female (worldly) power for male power in the form of love.</div><div>3/ MGTOW is understandable but it is self-defeating. Men and women complement each other. Both need love and sex. Sex must take place in the context of a loving relationship or it is essentially masturbation.</div><div>4/ Women have been brainwashed. A man has to reprogram the woman he loves. (See the movie, The Bostonians.\")</div><div>5. A woman is like a flower. If you give her love, she will blossom and bear fruit. We must be patient and persevering. Don't marry until you are really sure.</div><div>6. Having children and raising them to be good people is doing God's Work. How often do we get this opportunity?</div><div>Comments from men who saw the video:</div><div>Brad- Talking to women about this is akin to talking to a wall. It's useless because they (most) do not understand why the successful men aren't making them happy. They aren't making them happy because they have too much to lose, and the way a woman wants you to act toward them....not what they say, but what they want...to be dominated but adored, will net you a HUGE loss of wealth and quality of life. Why would anyone in their right mind accept a contract knowing that it's a net loss for you to initiate? Women will learn the same way as anyone else...when there is enough pain, they will change. MGTOW is just giving them the silent treatment they need to change. It's not a matter of if, but when. I've totally accepted the fate of being without a woman for the rest of my days. However, I hope for my daughter's sake, women as a whole change their attitudes before it's too late for her to have a family. Also, I don't only blame women in all this. Weak minded men are allowing this to happen because women need men to enforce everything. When men stop enforcing women's wants...it's over.</div><div><div>Evan- kind of wanted a wife and family. But I just can't! I've seen men lose their houses, their children and even kill themselves after a traumatic divorce. Every single couple I know that has been married has divorced, the wife has almost always been unfaithful. It's just impossible to have a wife and family anymore, so MGTOW for me is the only way.</div><div>J-Well done. Thanks for understanding. I went MGTOW back in 1997.</div><div>It's not all bad though. House paid off. My mechanic job brings in 4400 US dollars a month, spending is 1400, surplus usually about 3000 a month. And now I have enough accumulated wealth to retire (12 years early). I'm going to buy a camper for my pickup truck and go see some of this country now. I'll probably be retired around February of next year.</div><div>Vention MGTOW- Well done. Thanks for understanding.</div><div>I went MGTOW back in 1997.</div><div>It's not all bad though. House paid off.

I'm going to buy a camper for my pickup truck and go see some of this country now.

I predict a lot more because nothing beats freedom MGTOW4LIFE :)</div><div>Player Unknown -There's so many women in the US who have zero respect and appreciation for men. Expect everything and giving nothing but complaints in returns. Self-preservation seems to be the logical way to go.</div><div>Anon-it's growing in Africa too man don't want anything to do with women.</div><div>Black Torch-Already, Happening in Black American community. 51% of Black American men have no wife and no Children. And the refuse to talk to Black women in any capacity. It called the Wall of Silence. We are shooting for 80% by 2025. Good luck !</div><div>(left, In The Bostonians, 1984, Christopher Reeve reprograms feminist Madelaine Potter)</div><div>Henry Boaz- Getting a man is like getting a free meal ticket for life.</div><div>KL -- Met a 29 year old plumber that owned a home, I asked him if he was married, he said no. Asked him if he had a girlfriend, he said \"why would I ever do that?\" He saw what his mother did to his father, he made a chose long ago there's zero value in women!! I want him to talk to my son, to get him on the right track!!! God bless mgtow!!!</div><div>Ghost in the Machine - Most women. and some men. talk like MGTOW is temporary and that things will go back to 'normal' between men and women somewhere in the years ahead. You can hear it in their tone of voice or the choice of words they use. But, I disagree. Without strong social pressure, men are not going to go back to marriage and the family. I think most men I know would like to have a wife and family, but I also think they enjoy the freedom of being free to live their life the way they want and to be free of the responsibility of a wife and kids. I was married a short time and I still remember the constant pressure to support my wife and pay the bills. I've been single years since my divorce and it's so much easier to only be responsible for myself. The enjoyment of being free of responsibility, vastly outweighs the enjoyment of female company.</div><div>So what am I saying, you ask? I'm saying that once most men are set free from the responsibility of marriage in society, the social pressure to marry will be broken forever, and non-reversible. Marriage is a financial plus for women, but not such a good deal for men in today's world. After a man marries a women she quickly loses that 'new car smell', but the car payments go on and on. Nope, marriage is not a good deal for men today. In the past, social pressure and rites of manhood, demanded men get married, but not in modern society.</div><div>The old marriage model has been broken and it's not going to come back, ever. Men and women will still get married, but in very small numbers, and they will quickly divorce, not to remarry. Youtube men and women who talk like there is a solution (if it can just be found) are mistaken. It's wishful thinking. MGTOW is one-way, it's growing, and it's here to stay.</div><div>Women will not give up their new found (fill in the blank) freedom, and men will not give up their new found (fill in the blank) freedom. Both sides are unwilling to even consider going back to the way things were in past centuries. Which is understandable from either sides view. Anyone talking about compromise or love on daytime news commentary is dreaming.</div><div>--</div><div>Thanks to Michael Berg for sending this.</div><div>New Orleans Girl is said to be even better on MGTOW than Ukrainian Girl</div><div>Related- Reader Red Pills Men About Female Nature</div><div>Makow---Men Must Champion Feminine Women</div><div>---------- The Dying Art of Femininity</div><div>---------- Reclaiming Male Power</div><div>-----------------Wife Must Surrender to Husband to Achieve Unity</div><div>First Comment from John</div><div><div>Don't give up on women? Women have nothing to do with it, Henry. It is the State that is the problem. The State has set itself against men so it's not women we are up against as men, but the State. And the State will take our home, our money, our children and even our freedom using the EXCUSE of defending women's \"rights\". By eliminating women from our homes we eliminate the excuse the State uses to come in and destroy men's lives. Women are accomplices but without the role of the State women would be no problem, or at least no more of a problem than they have ever been. So MGTOW is really a way for men to protect themselves from THE STATE.</div></div></div></div>",
