It's useless because they (most) do not understand why the successful men aren't making them happy. They aren't making them happy because they have too much to lose, and the way a woman wants you to act toward them....not what they say, but what they want...to be dominated but adored, will net you a HUGE loss of wealth and quality of life. Why would anyone in their right mind accept a contract knowing that it's a net loss for you to initiate? Women will learn the same way as anyone else...when there is enough pain, they will change. MGTOW is just giving them the silent treatment they need to change. It's not a matter of if, but when. I've totally accepted the fate of being without a woman for the rest of my days. However, I hope for my daughter's sake, women as a whole change their attitudes before it's too late for her to have a family. Also, I don't only blame women in all this. Weak minded men are allowing this to happen because women need men to enforce everything. When men stop enforcing women's wants...it's over.﻿</span><br></p><div><p><span><b>Evan</b>-&nbsp; kind of wanted a wife and family. But I just can't! I've seen men lose their houses, their children and even kill themselves after a traumatic divorce. Every single couple I know that has been married has divorced, the wife has almost always been unfaithful. It's just impossible to have a wife and family anymore, so MGTOW for me is the only way.﻿</span></p><p><img alt=\"mgtow_stick_man_and_wife_t_shirt-r1d1d89b4e6c744909e06448e688cb96c_65ytt_307.jpg\" src=\"https://www.henrymakow.com/upload_images/mgtow_stick_man_and_wife_t_shirt-r1d1d89b4e6c744909e06448e688cb96c_65ytt_307.jpg\" width=\"307\" height=\"183\"></p><p><span><b>J-</b>Well done.

You can hear it in their tone of voice or the choice of words they use. But, I disagree. Without strong social pressure, men are not going to go back to marriage and the family. I think most men I know would like to have a wife and family, but I also think they enjoy the freedom of being free to live their life the way they want and to be free of the responsibility of a wife and kids. I was married a short time and I still remember the constant pressure to support my wife and pay the bills. I've been single years since my divorce and it's so much easier to only be responsible for myself. The enjoyment of being free of<span> </span></span><span>responsibility,</span><span><span> </span>vastly outweighs the enjoyment of female company.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So what am I saying, you ask? I'm saying that once most men are set free from the responsibility of marriage in society, the social pressure to marry will be broken forever, and non-reversible. Marriage is a financial plus for women, but not such a good deal for men in today's world. After a man marries a women she quickly loses that 'new car smell', but the car payments go on and on. Nope, marriage is not a good deal for men today. In the past, social pressure and rites of manhood, demanded men get married, but not in modern society.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The old marriage model has been broken and it's not going to come back, ever. Men and women will still get married, but in very small numbers, and they will quickly divorce, not to remarry. Youtube men and women who talk like there is a solution (if it can just be found) are mistaken. It's wishful thinking. MGTOW is one-way, it's growing, and it's here to stay.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Women will not give up their new found (fill in the blank) freedom, and men will not give up their new found (fill in the blank) freedom. Both sides are unwilling to even consider going back to the way things were in past centuries. Which is understandable from either sides view. Anyone talking about compromise or love on daytime news commentary is dreaming.﻿</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;--</span></p><p><span><i>Thanks to Michael Berg for sending this.</i></span></p><p><span><b>First Comment from John</b></span></p><p><span><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Don't give up on women? Women have nothing to do with it, Henry. It is the State that is the problem. The State has set itself against men so it's not women we are up against as men, but the State. And the State will take our home, our money, our children and even our freedom using the EXCUSE of defending women's \"rights\". By eliminating women from our homes we eliminate the excuse the State uses to come in and destroy men's lives.
