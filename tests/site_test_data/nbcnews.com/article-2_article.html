                                            <p class="">The daily newspaper Bild reported that Kohl died Friday at his
                                                home in Ludwigshafen.</p>
                                            <p class="">Over his 16 years at the country's helm from 1982 to 1998 —
                                                first for West Germany and then for all of a united Germany — Kohl
                                                combined a dogged pursuit of European unity with a keen instinct for
                                                history. Less than a year after the November 1989 fall of the Berlin
                                                Wall, he spearheaded the end of Germany's decades-long division into
                                                East and West, ushering in a new era in European politics.</p>
                                            <p class="">It was the close friendships that Kohl built up with other
                                                world leaders that helped him persuade both anti-communist Western
                                                allies and the leaders of the collapsing Soviet Union that a strong,
                                                united Germany could finally live at peace with its neighbors.</p>
                                            <p class="">"Helmut Kohl was the most important European statesman since
                                                World War II," Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president, said in 2011,
                                                adding that Kohl answered the big questions of his time "correctly for
                                                Germany, correctly for Europe, correctly for the United States,
                                                correctly for the future of the world."</p>

                                                said, describing Kohl as "a man who was big in more than physical

                                                conservative Christian Democratic Union, holding power for 16 years
                                                until his defeat by center-left rival Gerhard Schroeder in 1998.</p>
                                            <p class="">That was followed by the eruption of a party financing scandal

                                            <p class="">Kohl's legacy includes the common euro currency that bound
                                                Europe more closely together than ever before. Kohl lobbied heavily for
                                                the euro, introduced in 1999, as a pillar of peace — and when it hit
                                                trouble more than a decade later, he insisted there was no alternative
                                                to Germany helping out debt-strapped countries like Greece.</p>
                                            <p class="">Once viewed as a provincial bumbler, Kohl combined an
                                                understanding of the worries of ordinary Germans with a hunger for
                                                power, getting elected four times.</p>
                                            <p class="">Kohl served longer than Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first
                                                post-World War II chancellor and his political idol. Only Otto von
                                                Bismarck, who first unified Germany in the 1870s, was chancellor
                                                longer, for 19 years.</p>
                                            <p class="">"Voters do not like Kohl, but they trust him," Rita Suessmuth,

                                                Yeltsin.</p>
                                            <p class="">Kohl linked his dedication to a united Europe to his roots in a
                                                part of Germany close to France and his memories of a wartime boyhood.
                                                He celebrated the European Union's eastward expansion in 2004 with a
                                                speech declaring that "the most important rule of the new Europe is:
                                                There must never again be violence in Europe."</p>
                                            <p class="">Still, the "blooming landscapes" that Kohl promised East German
                                                voters during reunification were slow to come after the collapse of its
                                                communist economy, and massive aid to the east pushed up German
                                                government debt. He also drew criticism for failing to embark on
                                                economic reforms.</p>

                                            <p class="">Born on April 3, 1930, in Ludwigshafen, a western industrial
                                                city on the Rhine, Kohl joined the Hitler Youth but missed service in
                                                the Nazi army. As a 15-year-old, he was about to be pressed into
                                                service in a German anti-aircraft gun unit when World War II ended. His

                                            <p class="">A Roman Catholic, Kohl joined the CDU in his teens shortly
                                                after its postwar founding. He earned his doctorate in 1958 at the
                                                University of Heidelberg with a dissertation on the politics of
                                                Rhineland-Palatinate and became governor of that western state in 1969.</p>
                                            <p class="">His first attempt to unseat Social Democratic Chancellor Helmut
                                                Schmidt failed in 1976, but Kohl seized his chance six years later,
                                                taking power on Oct. 1, 1982 when a junior coalition party switched
                                                sides.</p>
                                            <p class="">He won elections in 1983 and 1987, then rode to an election
                                                triumph in 1990 on a wave of post-unity euphoria.</p>
                                            <p class="">Kohl was reluctant to view united Germany as a major power
                                                because of the Nazi past. Still, he slowly edged his country toward
                                                greater responsibilities in the 1990s, as Germany sent troops for U.N.
                                                humanitarian missions in Cambodia, Somalia and elsewhere, and deployed
                                                peacekeepers to Bosnia.</p>

                                            <p class="">He pursued reconciliation with Germany's eastern neighbors,
                                                though some critics said he moved too slowly after the fall of the Iron
                                                Curtain.</p>
                                            <p class="">Kohl was helped in securing German unity by his friendships
                                                with French President Francois Mitterrand and Soviet leader Mikhail
                                                Gorbachev, who approved NATO membership for a united Germany and agreed
                                                to pull Soviet troops out of East Germany.</p>
                                            <p class="">Kohl's earlier bridge-building with the U.S. also paid off. The
                                                stationing of U.S. Pershing II missiles starting in 1983, despite huge
                                                domestic protests, had established trust in Washington that was crucial
                                                to creating a single German state.</p>
                                            <p class="">"It was a stroke of luck that there were about four to six
                                                leaders in power in the mid-80s who really trusted one another and
                                                could really make things happen," Kohl later recalled. In his memoirs,
                                                he described former U.S. President George H.W. Bush as "the most

                                                her honesty, even as he recalled a confrontation with her just a few
                                                days after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
                                            <p class="">"I cited a 1970s-era NATO statement and said that NATO
                                                supported reunification. ... Thatcher stamped her feet in anger and
                                                screamed at me, 'That's how you see it! That's how you see it!'" he
                                                wrote.</p>
                                            <p class="">In a poignant gesture of reconciliation in 1984, Kohl held
                                                hands with Mitterrand during a ceremony at a World War I cemetery in
                                                Verdun, France.</p>

                                                year turned into a public relations fiasco. Kohl's trip with then-U.S.
                                                President Ronald Reagan to a war cemetery in Bitburg where SS troops
                                                were buried alongside ordinary German soldiers generated international

                                            <p class="">Kohl's relationship with Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader,
                                                also had to overcome early turbulence. In a 1986 interview, Kohl was
                                                quoted as comparing Gorbachev's public relations skills with those of
                                                Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The Soviet Union protested.</p>
                                            <p class="">Elation over German reunification ebbed amid the harsh
                                                realities of its cost and the difficulties of integrating east and
                                                west, but Kohl's coalition squeaked by again in 1994. Yet high
                                                unemployment and Germans' yearning for change gradually sapped his
                                                authority, provoking a humiliating loss to the younger Schroeder's
                                                center-left Social Democrats in 1998.</p>
                                            <p class="">The following year, Kohl plunged his party into crisis when he
                                                admitted accepting undeclared — and therefore illegal — donations
                                                during his time as chancellor. Kohl refused to identify the donors, to
                                                whom he said he had given his word.</p>
                                            <p class="">His silence helped trigger a parliamentary inquiry and was
                                                condemned by many, both inside and outside his party, but Kohl
                                                vehemently denied that any decisions by his government were bought.</p>

                                                followed him into the chancellery in 2005.</p>
                                            <p class="">In a 2001 deal with Bonn prosecutors, the probe was dropped in
                                                exchange for a 300,000-mark fine (about $140,000 at the time) — giving
                                                Kohl the legal stamp of innocence. That was a common German practice,
                                                not considered special treatment, but judicial investigations into
                                                other figures in the murky financing scandal continued.</p>
                                            <p class="">In another battle after his departure from power, Kohl fought
                                                and won a lengthy legal fight to prevent the release of most of the
                                                files held on him by East Germany's secret police. Journalists and
                                                historians had asked to see the material, prompting speculation it
                                                could shed light on the financing scandal. Kohl, however, argued
                                                successfully that the wiretaps used by the Stasi to spy on him were
                                                illegal and that he deserved protection from damage to his "human
                                                dignity."</p>
                                            <p class="">Kohl's estrangement from his party lasted until 2002, when its
                                                new leaders invited him to speak at a convention as they sought to
                                                regain power.</p>

                                            <p class="">The former chancellor was married for 41 years to Hannelore
                                                Renner, an interpreter of English and French who stood firmly but
                                                discreetly by his side throughout his political life. They had two
                                                sons, Peter and Walter.</p>
                                            <p class="">In July 2001, Hannelore killed herself at age 68 in despair
                                                over an incurable allergy to light. In 2005, Kohl introduced his new
                                                partner Maike Richter, an economist some 35 years his junior. The
                                                couple married in May 2008.</p>
                                            <p class="">Though slowed by illness in his later years, Kohl still made
                                                occasional eye-catching interventions on the political stage. As Merkel
                                                struggled to convince center-right lawmakers in 2011 of the wisdom of
                                                having Germany finance further bailouts of other eurozone nations, Kohl
                                                weighed in firmly. "There must be no question for us that we in the
                                                European Union and the eurozone stand by Greece in solidarity," he
                                                declared.</p>
                                            <p class="">He also appeared to question Merkel's approach at a time when
                                                conservatives were unsettled by her decision to speed up Germany's exit
                                                from nuclear energy and by Germany's abstention in a U.N. vote on a
                                                no-fly zone over Libya. "I ask myself where Germany stands today and
                                                where it wants to go," he said.</p>

                                            <p class="">In April 2016, Kohl welcomed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
                                                Orban — who had clashed with Merkel over Europe's approach to a large
                                                influx of refugees — to his home. That coincided with the publication
                                                of a new foreword to a Kohl essay in which the ex-chancellor stated
                                                that "Europe cannot become the new home for millions of people in need
                                                worldwide."</p>
                                            <p class="lastMarkupItem">Kohl and Orban said, however, that they saw no
                                                conflict with Merkel's efforts to solve Europe's migrant crisis.</p>
