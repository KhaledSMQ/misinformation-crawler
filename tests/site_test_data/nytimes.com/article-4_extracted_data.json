The dissenters said that allowing corporate money to flood the political marketplace would corrupt democracy.</p><p data-para-count=\"368\" data-total-count=\"907\">The ruling represented a sharp doctrinal shift, and it will have major political and practical consequences. Specialists in campaign finance law said they expected the decision to reshape the way elections were conducted. Though the decision does not directly address them, its logic also applies to the labor unions that are often at political odds with big business.</p><p data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"1171\">The decision will be felt most immediately in the coming midterm elections, given that it comes just two days after Democrats lost a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and as popular discontent over government bailouts and corporate bonuses continues to boil.</p><div id=\"story-ad-1\"><div><p>Advertisement</p></div><p>Continue reading the main story</p></div><p data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"1406\" id=\"story-continues-1\">President Obama called it “a major victory for big oil, Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans.”</p><p>Continue reading the main story</p></div></div><div id=\"story-continues-2\"><div id=\"FlexAd\"><div><p>Advertisement</p></div><p>Continue reading the main story</p></div></div><div><div><p data-para-count=\"183\" data-total-count=\"1589\" id=\"story-continues-3\">The justices in the majority brushed aside warnings about what might follow from their ruling in favor of a formal but fervent embrace of a broad interpretation of free speech rights.</p><figure aria-label=\"media\" data-media-action=\"modal\" id=\"media-100000000088758\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/01/22/us/22scotus_CA0/articleInline.jpg\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" role=\"group\"><p>Photo</p><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\">Justices Anthony M.

Kennedy wrote for the majority, which included the four members of the court’s conservative wing, “it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.”</p><p data-para-count=\"434\" data-total-count=\"2316\">The ruling, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, No. 08-205, overruled two precedents: Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a 1990 decision that upheld restrictions on corporate spending to support or oppose political candidates, and McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, a 2003 decision that upheld the part of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 that restricted campaign spending by corporations and unions.</p><p data-para-count=\"298\" data-total-count=\"2614\">The 2002 law, usually called McCain-Feingold, banned the broadcast, cable or satellite transmission of “electioneering communications” paid for by corporations or labor unions from their general funds in the 30 days before a presidential primary and in the 60 days before the general elections.</p><p data-para-count=\"200\" data-total-count=\"2814\">The law, as narrowed by a 2007 Supreme Court decision, applied to communications “susceptible to no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.”</p><p data-para-count=\"248\" data-total-count=\"3062\">The five opinions in Thursday’s decision ran to more than 180 pages, with Justice John Paul Stevens contributing a passionate 90-page dissent. In sometimes halting fashion, he summarized it for some 20 minutes from the bench on Thursday morning.</p><p data-para-count=\"190\" data-total-count=\"3252\">Joined by the other three members of the court’s liberal wing, Justice Stevens said the majority had committed a grave error in treating corporate speech the same as that of human beings.</p><div id=\"story-ad-2\"><div><p>Advertisement</p></div><p>Continue reading the main story</p></div><p data-para-count=\"391\" data-total-count=\"3643\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Eight of the justices did agree that Congress can require corporations to disclose their spending and to run disclaimers with their advertisements, at least in the absence of proof of threats or reprisals. “Disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way,” Justice Kennedy wrote.
