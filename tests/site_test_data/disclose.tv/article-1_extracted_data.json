If your state is blue or red, they will be forced to go with the popular, irrelevant if they are blue or red. Is that for the will of the people? It's to me, double edged. It IS for the will of the people as a nation, but is/will it be the will of the states people? How will your reps, represent YOU, if they MUST go with the popular vote? Say your whole state is Democrat. Every rep is Democrat. But a Republican has the \"popular\" vote. YOUR rep MUST vote for a republican???</p><p>Also, could this signal the end of the two party system? Or a party system to begin with? Would there be a point to a party system after this gets enough states to be the way?</p><p>I rarely delve into political post, but hell, I'm getting old, tired, get off my lawn. Might as well check it out. I've always had the mind, your vote ONLY counts locally, as in county/city. Anything beyond that relies on lifers in congress and state congresses. The insanity of it all.</p><p>The only change, that would be more impressive than this, would be each state to set term limits on those elected for congress. Because congress itself isn't going to set term limits on their own asses. LOL. We really need to push the agenda to make states set term limits on their members elected to congress.
