At a Montana rally Thursday night, Trump admitted, ‘I shouldn’t say this,’ but continued and said, ‘there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.'”</p><p>Well, those comments caused the leftists to feign fake outrage. How dare Trump condone violence against the press at a time like this, they asked, and they were quick to say he is responsible for Khashoggi’s death. That’s the new narrative which The View promoted in their segment, and Meghan ran with it.</p><p>She said, “I’m trying to hold, I’m trying really hard to hold myself to the same standards that I hope would be in the spirit of where I come from, the family I come from, and I hope across the board the Trumps could take a beat when one of our journalists has been slaughtered in the Middle East!”</p><p>Moments later she forcefully added, “So, he’s [Trump] not going to lead. We’re almost two years into his administration. So, we hold ourselves accountable. We’re television commentators, journalists as well. I just think if he can’t do it and he can’t be the example, we have to be the example we don’t have!”</p><p>This is what happens when you get a grandiose idea about yourself. Meghan exclaiming that “the Trumps needs to take a beat when one of our journalists has been slaughtered” is tantamount to saying the president’s joke in Montana and how he has come out against the leftist controlled media somehow contributed to Khashoggi’s death.</p><p>That’s just absurd. Maybe if Meghan and the shrews would have done their homework, they would realize the president had nothing to do with this reporter’s death. As The Washington Times reports, “Middle East insiders say some deeper subplots played into Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance — stemming from his long career of political activism, ties to Saudi intelligence and Mr. Khashoggi’s past relationship with the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood.”</p><p>They add, “Mr. Khashoggi, who was 59 when he disappeared at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, is said to have withdrawn years ago from any formal affiliation with the Brotherhood, but his past ties to the transnational Islamist group are believed to have been a source of distrust for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.”</p><p>The New York Times, citing interviews with longtime friends of Mr. Khashoggi, reported that he was in the midst of raising money for Democracy in the Arab World Now, or DAWN, when he disappeared in Turkey, whose own government is a rival to Saudi Arabia in the Muslim world and has close ties to Qatar and to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>Now, how has that got anything to do with President Trump?
