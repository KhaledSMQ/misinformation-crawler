For those who don’t know, Khashoggi was reportedly cut into pieces by Saudi operatives while inside their consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Right now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Istanbul trying to figure out the truth.</p>\n<p>But, instead of waiting for Pompeo, the Democrats are trying really hard to pin Khashoggi’s death on Trump, and that’s where the shrews of The View come in.

We’re almost two years into his administration. So, we hold ourselves accountable. We’re television commentators, journalists as well.

Maybe if Meghan and the shrews would have done their homework, they would realize the president had nothing to do with this reporter’s death. As <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/17/jamal-khashoggi-killing-sparked-muslim-brotherhood/\">The Washington Times</a> reports, “Middle East insiders say some deeper subplots played into Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance — stemming from his long career of political activism, ties to Saudi intelligence and Mr. Khashoggi’s past relationship with the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood.”</p>\n<p>They add, “Mr. Khashoggi, who was 59 when he disappeared at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, is said to have withdrawn years ago from any formal affiliation with the Brotherhood, but his past ties to the transnational Islamist group are believed to have been a source of distrust for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia.html\">New York Times</a>, citing interviews with longtime friends of Mr. Khashoggi, reported that he was in the midst of raising money for Democracy in the Arab World Now, or DAWN, when he disappeared in Turkey, whose own government is a rival to Saudi Arabia in the Muslim world and has close ties to Qatar and to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>\n<p>Now, how has that got anything to do with President Trump? And, if Meghan McCain and the shrews on The View are such hard-hitting journalists and television commentators, whom she claims should be the shining example for us all, well, she certainly has fallen short.</p>\n\n<p>This is just another example in a long list where Meghan McCain will ignorantly take the side of the leftist media to trash President Trump.
