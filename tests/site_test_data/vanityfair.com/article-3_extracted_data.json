    "plain_content": "<div><section><div><div><p>Late last year, when Pete Buttigieg first began reaching out to potential donors in advance of his long-shot presidential bid, one of the people he consulted was Howard Dean. The former Vermont governor had also mounted a dark-horse bid for the White House, in 2003, back when Buttigieg was downloading Phish MP3s from LimeWire in the Harvard residence halls. Dean is remembered by most political observers as surfing a massive grassroots wave from nowhere thanks to his early and fervent opposition to the Iraq war, an argument that flooded him with small online donations at a time when the Internet was only just beginning to de-stabilize American politics.</p><p>But Dean reminded Buttigieg of something lost in popular memory: his early support for civil unions. In April 2000, Dean had signed the nation’s first law allowing same-sex civil unions, then a groundbreaking step in the nation’s slow march to marriage equality. At the time, the law was so controversial, so aberrant to the American mainstream, that Dean had to wear a bulletproof vest at times in public. But as Dean began to assemble a presidential campaign, his support for civil unions was a door opener. Running for re-election in Vermont that fall, Dean was the toast of the L.G.B.T. fund-raising circuit, appearing at several events hosted by the Human Rights Campaign. He later appeared on the cover of The Advocate in a very hetero-looking fleece half-zip under the headline “A Civil Unions President?” His connections in the gay community would become foundational as he began to raise money and put together an organization.</p><p>“I’m not sure Howard Dean fully appreciated this at the beginning, but civil unions was kind of a made-up artifice,” said Elizabeth Birch, who was then the executive director of the Human Rights Campaign. “It had no legal meaning. It was made-up legal creature that had no history in the country. But because Dean had supported at least what would be the equivalent of a domestic partnership, that was the biggest step to date. He went on our dinner circuit. And the H.R.C. had really grown into a formidable organization. We bought talent from Silicon Valley and it became a real force. Dean was able to tap into that, appear at a number of dinners, and really impress people. He was intelligent. He was a truth-teller.”</p><p>Dean’s early ask to L.G.B.T. donors in 2002, as he launched his presidential exploratory committee, was similar to Buttigieg’s last year as he ramped up his potential bid: I might not be your first choice, but I’d appreciate some of your support as I try this. His rapport with the gay and lesbian political community was critical. It became the building block upon which he would capitalize as he broke into the mainstream. Big L.G.B.T. donors had fancier names to support, like John Kerry, Dick Gephardt, and John Edwards, but they also tossed some friendly extra cash Dean’s way because they respected his bravery on civil unions. “I showed up on the campaign early and almost everyone there was there because of civil unions,” said Nicco Mele, the “Web master” of the Dean campaign who now teaches at Harvard. “Almost all of the early money was around the civil-unions issue from the gay community.” Dean lost that 2004 campaign, but he raised more money than any candidate in the Democratic primary.</p><p>Seventeen years later, so much has changed. Other states began to recognize civil unions, then same-sex marriage. In 2012, President Barack Obama became the first sitting president to openly support marriage equality. The Supreme Court in 2015 made same-sex marriage the law of the land after a five-four ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. And today, an openly gay man is not only running for president, but has leapt to third place in the Democratic primary polls behind internationally famous candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Buttiegieg’s sexual orientation is not a central theme of his campaign message, but it doesn’t need to be for prominent L.G.B.T. donors who have grown accustomed to supporting candidates who are friendly on their issues, but never one their own.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“There is just this shock in the midst of this incredibly important presidential campaign that is simmering: you have an openly gay man who is catching fire,” said Corey Johnson, the 37-year-old Speaker of the New York City Council who is also gay and recently attended two packed Buttigieg fund-raisers in Manhattan, giddy events chronicled by my colleague Tina Nguyen. “Of course his message extends beyond his sexual identity, but in the L.G.B.T. community, people are used to supporting allies who have been our friends, but maybe not even fully your friends,” Johnson told me. “Maybe they once voted for DOMA or only quietly supported marriage equality. Now you have this young, openly gay mayor who is married. Whether you are a big donor or a random donor, there is this palpable excitement. People are kind of slack-jawed.”</p><p>But before Buttigieg could even think about catching fire, he had to find a way to pay for a staff, travel, and digital advertising. He initially followed Dean’s counsel, cracking open wallets in L.G.B.T. donor networks even if he was unable to lock down full-blown commitments from major bundlers. If Buttigieg could raise enough to get started and prove viability, the theory went, he could come back for more later. It worked: in the first quarter of 2019, Buttigieg was able to raise funds not just from adoring small donors over the Internet, but also from major L.G.B.T. donors who initially liked other candidates but were nevertheless enamored with Buttigieg’s history-making gamble. Buttigieg raised $7.1 million in the first quarter, out-raising all but three Democratic candidates and taking in more money than four sitting U.S. senators. Among 2020 candidates, according to the Associated Press, Buttigieg received the second-highest number of checks from donors who gave to multiple candidates.</p><p>Now that Buttigieg is firmly established as a credible candidate rather than just a Twitter-friendly novelty act, his financial support is growing more serious by the day. While he netted over $4 million from donors giving under $200 in the first quarter, some $2.5 million came from large donations, a sum likely to balloon in the coming months. Many L.G.B.T. donors who gave early to multiple candidates are now either firmly in Buttigieg’s corner or lining up to host big-money events for his campaign. Movie producer Richie Jackson hosted a finance event for Buttigieg in New York in April. This week, Buttigieg traveled to Chicago for an event with Democratic donors Eric Janssen and Marco Zerega. In May, Buttigieg will attend a fund-raising event in the Washington area co-hosted by Obama bundler Barry Karas, public affairs strategist Alex Slater, and lobbyist Steve Elmendorf, a top Hillary Clinton bundler who recently told CNBC that he’s fully in Buttigieg’s corner in the 2020 race.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Buttigieg, of course, has attracted financial support from plenty of straight bundlers as well, including from well-connected Obama and Clinton donors like Susie Tompkins Buell and Orin Kramer. But in conversation after conversation, it’s becoming clear that the high-dollar L.G.B.T. donor community has never been as excited about a presidential candidate as it is right now. “The gay community should speak freely and clearly, and to have someone on the national and international stage is meaningful to us,” said Rufus Gifford, the former ambassador to Denmark who was Obama’s national finance director in 2012. “As a public member of the gay community, it’s an inspiring voice, without a doubt. I have maxed out to Pete because of what you are seeing.”</p><p>Put simply, Buttigieg’s identity is helping him tap into a deep reservoir of politically engaged wealth that has, until recently, been watching the Democratic race somewhat tepidly. If Buttigieg manages to post a monster fund-raising number in the second quarter of this year, it won’t just be because small-donor millennials were fired up about his CNN town-hall appearances or his viral piano covers of Spoon songs. It will be thanks to a growing set of major fund-raisers, many of them gay and lesbian, who are coalescing behind him early and fast, delivering substantial checks that other Democratic candidates are choosing to leave on the big-money table.</p><p>“If you look in my sent e-mail box, I am constantly forwarding e-mails on to the campaign saying, ‘How can I get involved? I want to get involved. Can you connect me?’” said Jackson, the film producer. “Something very real is happening.”</p></div></div></section></div>",
