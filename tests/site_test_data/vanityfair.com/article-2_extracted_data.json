Ten days before Trump’s inauguration, BuzzFeed News published the document, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, raising questions about the veracity of its wilder claims, as well as speculation about who had funded Steele’s opposition research, and why.</p><p>As David Corn, who first reported on the dossier, wrote for Mother Jones in October 2016, the project originally began as opposition research by a U.S. firm (later identified as Fusion GPS) financed by a Republican. Steele (then identified only as a “former Western intelligence officer”) took over the project after its financing switched to a Democrat.
