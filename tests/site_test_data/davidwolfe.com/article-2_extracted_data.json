The lab found high levels of a chemical known as glyphosate in several popular foods. If glyphosate sounds familiar, it may be because you know this chemical as Monsanto’s Roundup weed-killer. Test results indicated that these foods have over 1,000 times the glyphosate levels that are considered to be harmful.</p><h3>The Harmful Effects of Glyphosate</h3><p>Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup product. The herbicide is applied to genetically engineered Roundup Ready crops. Scientists have deemed this chemical an important factor in many chronic diseases and health conditions, including:</p><ul><li>Autism</li><li>Crohn’s disease</li><li>Obesity</li><li>Allergies</li><li>Cardiovascular disease</li><li>Depression</li><li>Cancer</li><li>Infertility</li><li>Alzheimer’s disease</li><li>Parkinson’s disease</li><li>Multiple sclerosis</li></ul><p>Glyphosate damages the body by enhancing the effects of food-borne chemical residues and toxins in the environment. It disrupts normal body functions and can induce disease. Monsanto has continuously claimed that Roundup is harmless to animals and humans, but research suggests otherwise. The harmful chemical affects the beneficial bacteria in the body. It allows pathogens to grow and take over, causing inflammation and setting you down a dangerous path toward chronic and debilitating disease.</p><p>Research shows harmful impacts at glyphosate levels between 10 parts per billion and 700 parts per billion. When The Detox Project commissioned research of common foods, the results were worth sharing. They found that a bag of Lay’s kettle cooked original chips contained a level of glyphosate at 452.71 parts per billion! Knowing which foods to stay away from can allow you to keep yourself and your family safe from the dangerous health effects of glyphosate.</p><h3>Here are the test results:</h3><h3>General Mills</h3><ul><li>Cheerios – 1,125.3 parts per billion</li><li>Honey Nut Cheerios – 670.2 parts per billion</li><li>Wheaties – 31.2 parts per billion</li><li>Trix – 9.9 parts per billion</li><li>Annie’s gluten free bunny cookies, coca &amp; vanilla – 55.13 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>Kellogg’s</h3><ul><li>Kellogg’s Corn Flakes – 78.9 parts per billion</li><li>Kellogg’s Raisin Bran – 82.9 parts per billion</li><li>Kashi Organic Promise – 24.9 parts per billion</li><li>Kellogg’s Special K cereal – 74.6 parts per billion</li><li>Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes – 72.8 parts per billion</li><li>Cheez-It original – 24.6 parts per billion</li><li>Cheez-It whole grain – 36.25 parts per billion</li><li>Kashi soft baked cookies, oatmeal dark chocolate – 275.58 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>Nabisco</h3><ul><li>Ritz crackers – 270.24 parts per billion</li><li>Triscuit crackers – 89.68 parts per billion</li><li>Oreo original – 289.476 parts per billion</li><li>Oreo double stuff chocolate sandwich cookies – 140.90 parts per billion</li><li>Oreo double stuff golden sandwich cookies – 215.40 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>PepsiCo</h3><ul><li>Stacy’s simply naked pita chips – 812.53 parts per billion</li><li>Lay’s kettle cookies original – 452.71 parts per billion</li><li>Doritos cool ranch – 481.27 parts per billion</li><li>Fritos orginal – 174.71 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>Campbell Soup Company</h3><ul><li>Goldfish crackers original – 18.40 parts per billion</li><li>Goldfish crackers colors – 8.02 parts per billion</li><li>Goldfish crackers whole grain – 24.58 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>Little Debbie</h3><ul><li>Oatmeal creme pies – 264.28 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>Lucy’s</h3><ul><li>Oatmeal cookies gluten free – 452.44 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>Whole Foods</h3><ul><li>365 Organic golden round crackers – 119.12 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>Back to Nature</h3><ul><li>Crispy cheddar crackers – 327.22 parts per billion</li></ul><h3>Watch the video below for more information on the dangers of glyphosate:</h3><p>Sources: Waking Times Anresco Laboratories Dr. Mercola Glyphosate</p><div data-float=\"none\" data-float-color=\"#ffffff\" data-float-mobile=\"none\" data-min-width=\"1100\"><div data-network=\"facebook\">Share</div><div data-network=\"twitter\">Tweet</div><div data-network=\"pinterest\">Pin</div><div data-network=\"google_plus\">+1</div><div data-network=\"linkedin\">Share</div><div>2K Shares</div></div></div>",
