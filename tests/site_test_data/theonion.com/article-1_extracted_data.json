I thought for sure I’d be haunted by the memory of shooting that kid who snuck up on us back in Kabul, but I’ve truthfully never felt more at peace. I’m totally fine whenever I hear fireworks, too. If anything, they make me nostalgic for my childhood.” Anunoby went on to state that he does experience occasional flashbacks, but only of the great times he and his buddies used to have hanging out and having fun in between never-ending pitched battles against the Taliban.</p></div>",
