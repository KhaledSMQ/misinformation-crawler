Yet if you listen to the Socialist Authoritarians, you will hear that the people should ignore the rule of law when it conflicts with the collectivism that the liberal elites deem as the only policy that is acceptable to the supremacy of their socialist society. Note the famous response, “Outside Independence Hall when the Constitutional Convention of 1787 ended, Mrs. Powel of Philadelphia asked Benjamin Franklin, “Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” With no hesitation whatsoever, Franklin responded, “A republic, if you can keep it.”</p><p>From a historic perspective it would seem that an eighteenth century king was abhorrent to the cherished goals and aspirations of the American Revolution. Nevertheless the organized effort to undercut and replace representative government with a controlled mass hysteria of politically illiterate vermin has been the operative battle against the Republic.</p><p>Look at the reality of this treason. The Socialist Totalitarians function as a replacement for a singular regal king, while maintaining the royal power of a monarch administered by their elite technocrats, who manipulate the phony outrage and focus designed hysteria that is central to mob insurrection.</p><p>For Democrats who have embraced Socialism as their religion, the extension of their Realpolitik, substitutes the State as KING. Remember that Hitler came to power through political elections. The Democratic Party is now the embodiment of Fascism. While the corporatists wheel dominating influence in the GOP, the FDR prodigy of Socialists Democracy has adopted the tactics and intimidation of their own Brown Shirts. Silicon Valley autocrats seek to maintain their own Reich, not just in cyberspace but over the entire body politik.</p><p>Much like the indoctrinated Germans who followed the National Socialists, the people accepted propaganda and swallowed the official narrative. Their disconnect lead them to destruction. Compare this failure with the even more detrimental ideology of Socialists Democracy. The core element is a Marxist fraud that sucks in the naive, the dumb and stupid. Only a fool would defend the violence of the demented mob as they proclaim that the extremist ‘enlightened’ comrade solely has the ability to rule.</p><p>This formula is the actual result from preaching the lie that democracy is preferable to separations of power, limited government and constitutional representation.</p><p>The fake news that pollutes the corporate media is intended to destroy President Trump. Honest criticism in foreign policy is well deserved. Allowing NeoCons and State Department traitors to run roughshod; letting the War Party keep the unholy empire waging permanent warfare going is certainly Trump’s major mistake. However, his gut motives for improving relationships with Russia were sound.</p><p>Trump’s tilted support for Israel dooms his Middle East foreign policy. Now it is entirely understandable that the Zionist domination of the Federal establishment is a root cause of the hostility within the Deep State towards the challenge that an America First movement might break the chains of Jewish control over our political institutions.</p><p>Even so, the essential question for this midterm election asks would our country benefit more with a Democrat House of Representatives majority over keeping the GOP in power. No doubt the preferable option would be to break the two party scam of the same careerist corrupt culture, but any experienced political observer knows that won’t happen, once again.</p><p>President Trump represents the best opportunity to bring systematic reform and voting to keep a Republican House majority is the only way to move forward the bold Trump agenda. Putting Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in charge of committee chairmanships would kick off an endless trumped up impeachment circus.</p><p>The prospects of electing the most radical and extreme Socialists to a House majority is more than frightening, it is insane. The retirement of NeoCon Paul Ryan is most welcomed. So if the Republicans retain a majority, his replacement for House Speaker has current majority leader Kevin McCarthy, GOP Whip Steve Scalise or Rep. Jim Jordan in the mix.</p><p>Imagine an electorate that views Democrats more acceptable for a House majority because the liberal media is bent on removing President Trump from office. Why does the unsophisticated non partisan independent registered elector even consider voting for a Socialist Democrat? The likely answer rests upon the unsophisticated. They just do not understand that the Democrats are now the party that hates America.</p><p>The hoopla that Millennia’s will turn out in droves and cast their ballot for Democrats is unlikely when analyzed with previous cycles. However, the factor that might well select additional House seats is the Gerrymandering redistricting, like that in Pennsylvania, which is in place for the November 2018 elections. Still, the most serious component is voter fraud. California will be the leader of the pack after the midterm voting.</p><p>As for the Senate, more rational patterns should see the Republicans gain more seats. Just think how much better it would be if the 17th Amendment never passed, direct election of United States Senators by popular vote. The current method, which perverts the populace with Socialists Democracy has put into office blue state fellow travelers.</p><p>The pragmatic assessment that the Trump presidency has turned the country from an Obama malaise of a deep crisis into a healthy economy with the prospects of a bright future for the middle class cannot be denied. Thus far the distorted polls would have you believe that a blue wave will still result on November 6.</p><p>Do not accept this lie. And if this appraisal proves wrong, the case that the public is too dim-witted to elect anyone grows stronger. Then again as the election rapidly approaches, the jackpot for Tuesday’s Mega Millions drawing is up to $1.6 billion having about the same odds as Socialists Democracy bringing prosperity with more free stuff from the government by voting for Democratic candidates. A dream for the gullible and ignorant. And still people refuse to accept that the Republic has been betrayed by the collectivists.</p><p>SARTRE – October 23, 2018</p><p>Read the entire article on the BATR archive page</p><p>Subscription sign-up for the BATR RealPolitik Newsletter</p><p>Discuss or comment about this essay on the BATR Forum</p><div><div>EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

This pundit's formal instruction in History, Philosophy and Political Science served as training for activism, on the staff of several politicians and in many campaigns.</p><p>A believer in authentic Public Service, independent business interests were pursued in the private sector. As a small business owner and entrepreneur, several successful ventures expanded opportunities for customers and employees. Speculation in markets, and international business investments, allowed for extensive travel and a world view for commerce. He is retired and lives with his wife in a rural community.</p><p>\"Populism\" best describes the approach to SARTRE's perspective on Politics. Realities, suggest that American Values can be restored with an appreciation of \"Pragmatic Anarchism.\" Reforms will require an Existential approach. \"Ideas Move the World,\" and SARTRE'S intent is to stir the conscience of those who desire to bring back a common sense, moral and traditional value culture for America.</p><p>Not seeking fame nor fortune, SARTRE's only goal is to ask the questions that few will dare ...

Why does the unsophisticated non partisan independent registered elector even consider voting for a Socialist Democrat? The likely answer rests upon the unsophisticated. They just do not understand that the Democrats are now the party that hates America."

However, the factor that might well select additional House seats is the Gerrymandering redistricting, like that in Pennsylvania, which is in place for the November 2018 elections. Still, the most serious component is voter fraud. California will be the leader of the pack after the midterm voting."

Just think how much better it would be if the 17th Amendment never passed, direct election of United States Senators by popular vote. The current method, which perverts the populace with Socialists Democracy has put into office blue state fellow travelers."

Then again as the election rapidly approaches, the jackpot for Tuesday’s Mega Millions drawing is up to $1.6 billion having about the same odds as Socialists Democracy bringing prosperity with more free stuff from the government by voting for Democratic candidates. A dream for the gullible and ignorant. And still people refuse to accept that the Republic has been betrayed by the collectivists."
