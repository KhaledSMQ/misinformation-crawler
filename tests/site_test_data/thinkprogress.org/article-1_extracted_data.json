    "content": "<div><p>Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned Thursday, one day after President Donald Trump thwarted Mattis and others in his administration by announcing he would pull American troops out of Syria. President Trump wrote in a tweet that Mattis would leave his post in February.</p><p>Mattis, a former U.S. Marine Corps general who served as the head of the United States Central Command from 2010 to 2013, is the 10th Cabinet-level official to depart in the first two years of the president’s tenure.</p><p>He was part of a troika of former high-ranking military officers — the others were former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly — who were considered a collective, steadying influence inside the Trump White House.</p><p>Though he didn’t mention Syria in his letter, Mattis made clear he was leaving because he disagreed with the commander in chief on issues that were central to his job and to the direction of the country.</p><p>“One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,” Mattis wrote. “While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.”</p><p>Democrats and Republicans alike decried the resignation.</p><p>“This is a very sad day for our country,” said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader who is expected to become speaker next month. “Read his letter. And examine the activities that have led up to it...Because of his leadership we are safe. Yes. And we have to pray that we’re safe and we have to continue to make sure the American people are sure we’re safe....We shouldn’t have to do so because of the temper tantrums of the commander in chief.”</p><p>“I slept better at night knowing that General Mattis was protecting our nation, our allies, and our brave men and women in uniform – many of whom I’ve worked with in the trenches,” tweeted Will Hurd, a Texas Republican and former CIA agent. “This is bad news for the nation and the security of the world.”</p><p>The New York Times, citing official sources, reported that Mattis went to the White House on Thursday afternoon in a last attempt to convince Mr. Trump to keep American troops in Syria, where they have been fighting the Islamic State. He was rebuffed, and told the president that he was resigning as a result.</p><p>Trump tried to put a positive spin on the resignation.</p><p>In a two-part tweet Thursday evening, the president wrote, “General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years. During Jim’s tenure, tremendous progress has been made, especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting equipment. General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly.
