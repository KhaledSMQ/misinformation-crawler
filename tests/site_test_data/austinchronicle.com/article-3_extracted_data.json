Experience has shown that law changes like this help create jobs and increase the total amount of craft beer sold by breweries, distributors and retailers,” said Saint Arnold Brewing founder/brewer and overall beer rights zealot Brock Wagner in a press release.</p><p>The Wholesale Beer Distributors of Texas recently relented on its previous resistance to Beer-to-Go, signing an agreement with the Texas Craft Brewers Guild and fellow big distro (but slightly cooler) pals the Beer Alliance of Texas. The agreement lent support for off-premise sales from manufacturing breweries in Texas. This buy-in from the WBAT appears to be the domino that tipped the line as the Beer-to-Go amendment gained sudden urgency only after that specific distributor group got onboard. In this agreement, beer fans would be able to buy one case (up to 288 fluid oz) of beer per day, per person directly from manufacturing breweries. Originally, the agreement between the TCBG and BAT sought two cases per person, per day. The group also agreed not to amend this version of the bill for 12 years.</p><p>The senate version of the TABC bill, with Beer-to-Go attached, will now go back to the House of Representatives for either a fast-track “concur” approval, or for another round of debate that would include a small group of representatives and senators forming a conference committee set up to reconcile the differences between the two bills. That bill, should it gain final approval between the two houses, would then seek Gov. Abbott’s blessing for a whole new world of very normal, everyday stuff that literally every other state already enjoys.</p></div>",
