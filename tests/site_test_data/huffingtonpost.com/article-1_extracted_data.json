The results showed a majority of voters would likely oppose policies with stringent mandates ― rules requiring all cars be electric by 2030 and every fossil fuel power plant close by 2035.</span></p><p>To test the support, Data for Progress commissioned the Democratic pollster Civis Analytics to survey 3,496 likely voters between Jan. 4 - 26 on 11 policies expected to be included a Green New Deal. The poll tested four different cost scenarios on each question, randomly alternating between zero, low, medium and high prices to test how the cost of a policy weighed on one-quarter of respondents&rsquo; opinions.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The green jobs guarantee, considered by Green New Deal proponents to be the heart of the suite of policies, proved one of the tricker components. In a lengthy prompt, the survey asked respondents if they support or oppose a policy that Democrats promised would &ldquo;guarantee an environmentally friendly job to every American adult, with the government providing jobs for people who can&rsquo;t find employment in the private sector.&rdquo; </span></p><p>The question described the job as a position that would pay &ldquo;at least $15 an hour, included healthcare benefits, and collective bargaining rights.&rdquo;&nbsp;The surveyors added that Republicans warned the policy &ldquo;would increase the national debt, endanger the long term health of our economy, and this policy will end up paying people who can&rsquo;t contribute in the job market to perform pointless busy work.&rdquo;</p><p>Thirty-nine percent supported the green jobs guarantee, 33 percent opposed and 27 didn&rsquo;t know. Without a price, voters were 9 percentage points likelier to support than oppose the policy. At a low of $100 billion, support hit 2 percentage points. Voters were about evenly divided on policies costing $500 billion or $1 trillion.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mandates requiring the country to generate 100 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2050 enjoyed sweeping support. The question noted that Democrats believed such a policy would &ldquo;kickstart the renewable energy sector, creating jobs for many Americans and ensuring that America leads the world in green technology,&rdquo; while Republicans said, &ldquo;this would take away freedom from American consumers, put people out of work, and raise prices for everything from transportation to consumer goods.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty-eight percent supported the proposal, 33 percent opposed and 30 percent didn&rsquo;t know. Without a price, voters backed the policy by 7 percentage points. At a low of $25 billion, that figure fell to 2 percentage points. Support held steady at 1 percentage point for both a medium cost of $37.5 billion and a high of $50 billion. Age impacted support at the unstated price level. Voters aged 18 to 34 supported the policy by 15 percentage points, while those 65 and older opposed the policy by 11 percentage points. </span></p><p>Policies improving drinking water infrastructure proved to be the most popular. The survey outlined a proposal to improve infrastructure &ldquo;and replace lead pipes,&rdquo; considering that Republicans &ldquo;say that our drinking infrastructure is in good shape already, and this represents a wasteful use of resources that will burden our children with debt.&rdquo;</p><p>Half of the respondents supported the proposal, 21 percent opposed and 29 percent didn&rsquo;t know. At no stated price, voters supported the proposal by 36 percentage points. Faced with a low cost of $25 billion, <span style="font-weight: 400;">support sank to 27 percentage points. At a medium cost of $37.5 billion, the percentage dropped to 23. At a high of $50 billion, it fell to 22 percentage points. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The least popular policy was one &ldquo;proposing requiring that all new cars sold be electric by 2030.&rdquo; The question said, &ldquo;Democrats say this would help stop climate change, save thousands of lives by reducing pollution, and make the U.S. the definitive leader in the electric car industry.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans say this would take away freedom from American consumers, put people&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">making cars out of work, and make new cars unaffordable for the average American. Do you support or oppose this policy?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just 26 percent supported the policy, with 44 percent opposed and 33 percent unsure. Without even seeing a price, voters opposed the electric car mandate by 15 percentage points. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second-least popular was a proposal &ldquo;requiring that all fossil fuel plants (coal, natural gas and oil) cease operating by 2035&rdquo; in an effort to &ldquo;help stop climate change&rdquo; that Republicans say &ldquo;would put many Americans out of work, and could lead to an energy crisis as energy prices soar.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters opposed the measure by 3 percentage points, again without seeing a price. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings come just weeks before the Senate is expected to hold a vote on the Green New Deal resolution Sen.
