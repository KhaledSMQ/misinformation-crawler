Beto O’Rourke also are expected to make highly anticipated 2020 announcements in the coming weeks.</p><p>Inslee acknowledges his underdog status but says his emphasis on combating climate change will set him apart.</p><p>“Climate change is a unifying issue,” Inslee told The Associated Press in a recent interview, calling it a moral necessity and an economic opportunity.</p><p>He promises substantial investment in clean energy sources that reduce American dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p>“This issue is connected to virtually every other value system and thing we want to do in our communities,” he said, mentioning environmental justice, infrastructure, clean energy, health care and national security.</p><p>Inslee argues that no presidential candidate has hinged a campaign as heavily on climate and environmental policy as he will.

The Green New Deal targets 2030 for the U.S. to become net carbon neutral.</p><p>Despite his emphasis on climate policy, Inslee says he’s not a one-issue candidate. A former congressman, he pitches his breadth of personal and political experiences as ideal to bridge political and cultural divides among the Democratic base and the broader electorate.</p><p>Inslee is a white male baby boomer who was a clean-cut star athlete and honors student in the turbulent 1960s, when he met his high school sweetheart, Trudi. She is now his wife of 46 years. That puts Inslee closer to the septuagenarian Biden than to the young rock-star-style candidates like O’Rourke or Booker, both still in their 40s.</p><p>Inslee has nonetheless governed Washington as an unabashed liberal, promoting clean energy, gay rights, abortion rights, environmental preservation, tighter gun restrictions and more spending for education and job training.
