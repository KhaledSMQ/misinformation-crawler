The lead paragraph was no less provocative: “Federal investigators have concluded that ‘Star Wars’ officials conducted a deception program in the 1980s as part of a plan to make the Soviet Union think the ballistic missile-defense project was far more advanced than it was.</p><p>‘Deja Vu All Over Again’</p><p>Such statements call to mind the frenzy kicked off by Mr. Weiner at approximately the same point during last year’s budget cycle. On 18 August 1993, the New York Times gave front-page treatment to a libelous and factually unfounded story under Mr. Weiner’s by-line concerning a 1984 missile intercept test called the Homing Overlay Experiment (HOE). This test, the fourth in a series conducted by the Army and sponsored of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), was deemed an extraordinary success — involving the first successful destruction of one missile by another by direct impact, without the aid of explosive devices. As such, it was pointed to as a proud proof of the feasibility of advanced strategic defenses by their supporters. And for SDI’s critics, debunking or discrediting this test became a high priority.</p><p>It was, consequently, momentous when Tim Weiner charged in the Times that the fourth HOE test was deliberately “rigged” to assure its success, to deceive the Soviets and — intentionally or otherwise — to con the Congress. He quoted “former Reagan Administration officials” (sic) as saying that “to insure that the missile defense program would be seen as a success, the test was faked.” And he cited an unnamed “scientist” to the effect that: “We put a beacon with a certain frequency on the target vehicle. On the interceptor we had a receiver.” Mr. Weiner added, “In effect, the scientist said, the target was talking to the missile, saying: ‘Here I am. Come and get me.'” Congressional critics of the SDI program like Sen. David Pryor (D-AR) and Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) were quoted in the article confirming the thrust of the report and/or expressing outrage at its content in a way calculated to lend authority to Mr. Weiner’s claims.</p><p>In fact, the report about the beacon transmitting targeting data to the interceptor — like so much in Mr. Weiner’s reporting — was absolutely wrong. The interceptor had no C-Band radio receiver compatible with and capable of reading what was being transmitted from the target for range-safety and other instrumentation purposes. On 9 September 1993, then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin announced the results of a Pentagon investigation into this and other charges served up by Mr. Weiner and the New York Times: “[The experiment] was not rigged by the inclusion of a radar beacon...on the target or by any other means. The experiment demonstrated what it purported to demonstrate, namely that the final guidance of the interceptor to a direct hit was done by the onboard heat seeker.”^(1)</p><p>On that occasion, Secretary Aspin also disputed other points prominently featured in the original Weiner articles and a subsequent one published on 27 August 1993. ^(2) These included, notably, distortions and/or misrepresentations concerning the use and nature of measures to enhance the signature of the fourth HOE test’s target vehicle. They also described the placement aboard the target of “a bomb” that purportedly was to be used to suggest that an intercept had been achieved — even if it had not been. In his rebuttal, Mr. Aspin essentially endorsed statements challenging the Weiner reports that had previously been issued by his predecessor, Caspar Weinberger, by the director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization at the time of the fourth HOE test, Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, and by the then-commander of the Army Strategic Defense Command, Maj. Gen. Eugene Fox.^ ^(3)</p><p>When In Doubt, Press On</p><p>What is really remarkable about Mr. Weiner’s latest assault on the truth is that much of the article published last weekend actually documents his previous inaccuracies and misrepresentations. In fact, in reporting on the results of a General Accounting Office study (performed at the request of Sen. Pryor after the results of Secretary Aspin’s investigation were made known), Mr. Weiner gave the careful reader plenty of reason to distrust his accuracy, if not his integrity. The following quotes from the Weiner article of 23 July are illustrative:</p><ul><li>The GAO found that the original Weiner report was egregiously wrong: “The [GAO] report directly contradicted accusations, made by four men who worked for the Star Wars program...that Star Wars officials rigged the fourth test in the series as part of the deception program. It found no evidence that a beacon on board the target missile sent a signal to the interceptor missile saying, in effect, ‘come and get me’....”</li><li>The GAO found that the test was “not deceptive”: “The report said the enhancements Star Wars officials took to double the chance that the fourth test would succeed were secretive, but not deceptive.” (Emphasis added.)</li><li>The GAO found that the test was not part of the so-called “deception” plan: “The deception program had been abandoned [in 1984] and, in the opinion of the [GAO] investigators, no deceptive measure remained....”</li><li>The GAO found that the so-called “bomb” could not be used as part of a deception: “A bomb [actually a spotting charge consisting of a mere 320 grams of high explosive] was on board the target missile in the fourth test, though military officials told the investigators that it was not wired to go off on...command.”</li><li>The GAO found that the test practices were “reasonable”: “The investigators concluded that these enhancements were reasonable from the perspective of Strategic Defense Initiative officials trying to prove the program could work.”^(4)</li></ul><p>In short, the General Accounting Office — an organization known for its studies’ uncanny ability to provide congressional sponsors with virtually any conclusion they want — has produced a study for Sen. Pryor that has a bottom line that is, presumably, very different from the one desired: On virtually every point, Tim Weiner’s case against the Strategic Defense Initiative and its leaders was erroneous. This fact may explain why this GAO study remains classified and unavailable except when leaked to journalists like Mr. Weiner.</p><p>The Bottom Line</p><p>The Center for Security Policy deplores the blatant advocacy journalism in which Tim Weiner and the New York Times persist in opposing programs to defend the United States against missile attack. Surely a new low has been reached in this regard, however, when the Times uses precious page-one space to compound the damage it has previously done to the program — and the national interest — by promoting afresh assertions that have repeatedly been disproved. The Center calls for the immediate release of the GAO study on the Weiner charges. And it calls upon the newspaper that considers itself to be the Nation’s journal of record to present the GAO’s conclusions fairly — i.e., under a front-page headline and lead graph that accurately describe what amounts to a complete vindication for the SDI program and a thorough repudiation of Mr. Weiner and the New York Times.</p><p align=\"center\">– 30 –</p><p>1. Interestingly, in his 23 July article, Mr. Weiner chose to make no mention of the findings of the study commissioned by Mr. Aspin in response to his earlier reporting. Perhaps he feared that, had he reminded his editors of the wholesale debunking of his earlier journalistic feats, his latest efforts would have been given appropriately short shrift — rather than front-page placement.</p><p>2.

( href=”index.jsp?section=papers&amp;code=93-P_77′′&gt;No. 93-P 77, 9 September 1993).</p><p>3.

This conclusion closely tracks with a May 1988 publication by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment entitled, SDI: Technology Survivability and Software. This study makes clear that OTA — an institutional hotbed of SDI critics — was aware of and untroubled by the steps taken as part of a legitimate weapons development effort:</p><blockquote><p>“The simulated reentry vehicle (RV) fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California [as the target for the fourth HOE test] radiated about 10 times more infrared (IR) energy than that expected from today’s Soviet RVs, and future RVs could have even lower IR signatures with thermal shrouds....These comments on the SDI validation experiments should not be construed as criticism of SDI Organization management.
