  "title": "Beware Soros's \"Rented Evangelicals\"",

  "plain_text": [
    "As Soros-funded “ministers” are on buses through swing states to “flip Congress,” our friends with the American Association of Evangelicals (AAE) have just put out a 3-minute video, Soros’s “Rented Evangelicals.”*  It provides a lot of info in a short time and is reaching many thousands of people each day through social media.",
    "“Soros’s Rented Evangelicals” is a  wake-up call that we urge you to share with your family, friends, church and club members to alert them to this assault on the Body of Christ.",
    "This is a very complex story, however, as leaked documents obtained by our friends at AAE confirm, and as Rev. Jim Wallis of Sojourners eventually admitted, wealthy, anti-Christian foundations, following the lead of billionaire George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, fund and “rent” curious \"evangelical\" and \"Catholic\" \"mascots” serving as deceptive validators for their causes. The consequent realities include injury to countless people, the Church, the family, nation and the global Church including many martyrs.",
    "Consider some of the consequences of 'Progressive' political activism over the past few decades documented by AAE:",
    "A growth industry trafficking in human baby organs and body parts, funded and defended by the Democratic Party.",
    "The abandonment of a biblical view of marriage that protected and liberated children and adults from centuries of pagan slavery, poverty, polygamy and non-life-giving sexuality.",
    "The Transgender agenda including gender \"reorientation\" of our children, also being forced on our neighbors, businesses, schools, military and churches.",
    "Socialism, higher taxes and government regulations. These policies stifle human creativity, productivity, family stability and generosity. Such policies increase joblessness, welfare dependency and national debt.",
    "Heightened racial division and tension, and the growing phenomenon of paid demonstrators being recruited and dispatched to instigate protests that often become riots.",
    "Open borders and lawless ‘sanctuary’ cities increasing drugs, disease, crime, gangs and terrorism.",
    "Amnesty efforts that attempt to give voting rights to millions of non-citizens, giving the results of our elections and nation's future to many who disregarded our laws, customs, history, identity and values. This does not honor our long-standing tradition of legal immigration to those who come in good faith and to assimilate and bless America.",
    "Forced refugee resettlement in hundreds of American cities without citizen consent, mandated by the Obama-era federal government in partnership with the United Nations. (Refugees were primarily non-assimilating Muslims, while authorities often reject persecuted Christians.)",
    "Hostility towards Judeo-Christian religious liberty in our courts, large corporations, media and universities including the suppression of conservative speakers, free thought and moral education.",
    "The growing recognition of a \"Deep State\" within our government, including ideological bureaucrats embedded in our DOJ, IRS, FBI and Department of State, that intimidates and seeks to subvert conservative, patriotic and Christian groups that disagree with the 'Progressive' political establishment.",
    "After such demoralization and pain, asked AAE, why would any religious leader ask Christians to embrace, support or vote for a Progressive political agenda that is clearly anti-Christian?",
    "When Hillary Clinton stated during a 2015 speech at the Women in the World Summit that religious beliefs “have to be changed,” she revealed the radical Left's war on Christian believers and the Church.",
    "And now the Religious Left claims that supporting such a view is the Christian thing to do?  This is spiritual abuse of human beings, the family, the Church and the nation.",
    "“The framers of our Constitution meant we were to have freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.” Rev. Billy Graham",
    "For many years, Soros’s Open Society and other liberal foundations have funded not only most of the disturbing campaigns mentioned above (1-10) but also the Religious Left, using and creating ostensibly evangelical and Catholic organizations to “message and mobilize” Christians into Progressive causes. They use the Marxist-Alinsky tactic of funding “ministers” who cherry-pick faith language to confuse and divide the Church’s morality, mission and vote.",
    "At a time when many Christian ministries are struggling, a few of the Soros network “faith” and “interfaith” grantees are Jim Wallis of Sojourners, Richard Cizik’s New Evangelical Partnership, Telos, J Street to malign Israel, Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, Faithful America and Gamaliel. Faith in Public Life to “counter” Christians and conservatives in the media and, with PICO, advocate for amnesty, mass Islamic migration, and even to attempt to influence the visit and priorities of the Vatican and Pope Francis himself. Billions of additional dollars to “Christian VOLAGs” for large scale “refugee” and migrant resettlement come from the Obama administration.",
    "Joining “faith” fronts, the Soros network also funds thousands of other collaborators and projects that suggest a pattern and goal to demoralize America (and Europe). The list includes: film studios and hundreds of media outlets; attempts to control the Internet; racial and gender agitation; euthanasia; drug legalization and “injection zones;” abortion and the “sex worker” industry; Al Gore’s Climate campaign; pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel projects; the rights of jihadists and Sharia advocates.",
    "In the ironic rhetoric of compassion, Soros and allies fund mass immigration, redistricting schemes, illegals' voting “rights,” protests and smears on Judge Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court, while financing the 2018 campaigns of Democrats Andrew Gillum (D-FL), Jon Tester (D-MT), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), Krysten Sinema (D-AZ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and many more. (Soros has long been a major donor to the Democratic Party, co-chairman of Ready for Hillary PAC and previously funded Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Al Franken and many far-Left Democrats).",
    "One wonders if the end goal is the destruction of national identity through demoralization, open borders and debt, thus the “fundamental transformation” (weakening) of American civil society for their leveraged global power. (Soros broke the Bank of England, is a convicted felon in France, and is undermining many nations.)",
    "We urge you to go to https://americanevangelicals.com/ for more information on Soros and his releationship with some who claim to be speaking for Evangelical Christians. We should all question the true intentions of persons or organizations that receive money from Soros and related globalist social engineers. We must not give America's future to him and his surrogates, for more harm.",
    "*The phrase comes from the New America Foundation strategy, “Rent An Evangelical” and “Rent A General” as “mascots.”"
